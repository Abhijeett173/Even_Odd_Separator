# Even-Odd Number Separator

This Python program takes a list of integers as input and separates them into:
- Even numbers  
- Odd numbers  

## 📌 How It Works
1. The user enters how many numbers they want to input.
2. The program stores them in a list.
3. Numbers are separated into even and odd lists.
4. Both lists are printed as output.
